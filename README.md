## <p align=center>An Object-Oriented Program using `Weapons` as a Class
### <p align=center>CS-1204 Team 9 <br />

##### Context:
Our class in CS 121 was tasked to do our laboratory activity 3 and 4 about our topic--Object Oriented Programming that focuses on classes. Our team was assigned to create a program that uses classes and was given `Weapons` to use as our topic.

<br />

##### Description:
This Python software develops a weapon management system based on object-oriented programming concepts. It consists of an abstract base class AbstractWeapon, which has common properties such as name, level, damage, and durability, and an abstract method special_attack. The Weapon class inherits from AbstractWeapon and implements the special_attack method, which activates unique special powers for some weapons. The WeaponManager class keeps many weapon types, including swords, marksman, casters, and rangers. Each weapon category provides a variety of weapons with unique qualities. The application allows users to select a weapon class, select a weapon from the available options, check its stats, use the weapon, and activate its special attack (if the weapon does have one).
