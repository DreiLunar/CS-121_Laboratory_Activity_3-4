# ***Weapon Picker***
### An Object-Oriented Program using `Weapons` as a Class
##### By CS-1204 Team 9

##### About:
This Python software develops a weapon management system based on object-oriented programming concepts. It consists of an abstract base class AbstractWeapon, which has common properties such as name, level, damage, and durability, and an abstract method special_attack. The Weapon class is inherits from AbstractWeapon and implements the special_attack method, which activates unique special powers for some weapons. The WeaponManager class keeps many weapon types, including swords, marksman, casters, and rangers. Each weapon category provides a variety of weapons with unique qualities. The application allows users to select a weapon class, select a weapon from the available options, check its stats, use the weapon, and activate its special attack (if the weapon does have one).
